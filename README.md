TLDR?  
Suppose you are the manager of a big supermarket. Imagine some customers who bought the mangoes from you suddenly stormed into the store and complaint about the fruit. They tell you that eating those mangoes upsets their stomach. And now you want to find the source of the mangoes.  
Now you want to find the source of the mangoes. It becomes a hunt for emergency information. And the days of searching will actually cost you and your customer a hefty price, maybe a legal hurdle too.  
The reason for all chaos is that the information that you seek is scattered across a vast, intricate, and diverse supply chain network, and tracing the information is just as tedious as it sounds.
